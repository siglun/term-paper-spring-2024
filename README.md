# A small paper

A discussion of the knowledge argument based on papers by Jackson
(1986) and Pereboom (1994). It seems that the former treatment of the
problem survives attacks from the latter.

Physicalism is a moving target: The physics which is the result of a
reduction varies with what physical theory is popular among
philosophers at each moment in time; from billiard balls, to
physico-chemical processes, molecular genetics and possibly, in the
future, quantum gravity.

Written as a deliverable for the course FTEA13:5 – Philosophy of Mind,
which is a part of the introduction into theoretical philosophy at
Lund university https://www.fil.lu.se/kurs/FTEA13/.
