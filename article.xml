      <div type="abstract">
	<p>A discussion of the knowledge argument based on papers by <ref
	target="#frankjackson1986">Jackson (1986)</ref> and <ref
	target="#derkpereboom1994">Pereboom (1994).</ref>
	It seems that the former treatment of the problem survives attacks from the latter.</p>
	<p>Physicalism is a moving target:
	The physics which is the result of a reduction varies with what physical theory is popular  among philosophers at each moment in time;
	from billiard balls, to physico-chemical processes, molecular genetics and possibly, in the future, quantum gravity.</p>

	<head>Introduction</head>

	<p rend='noindentfirst'>Biology is, writes <ref
	target="#jjcsmart1959">Smart (1959: 142),</ref> <hi
	rend='italic'><quote xml:id="unbelievable_according_to_smart">to physics as radio-engineering is to
	electromagnetism) except the occurrence of sensations seems to
	me to be frankly unbelievable.</quote></hi> The effect such a
	statement have on biologists and biologically inclined philosophers could be easily foreseen.
	I think it is safe to assume that Smart was wilfully provocative.
	<ref target="#jjcsmart1959">Smart's (op cit.)</ref> and others' works led to
	a <hi rend='italic'><quote>wave of reductionist euphoria</quote></hi>
	or that is how <ref target="#thomasnagel1974">Nagel (1974: 435)</ref>
	puts it in his seminal paper <title>What is it like to be a bat</title>.
	Nagel discusses at length that chiropterology (the scientific study of bats) has to investigate
	<hi rend="italic">how it is like</hi>
	how to see the world using echolocation.</p>

	<p>Nagel was later joined by Jackson who wrote a series of papers,
	including <title>What Mary Didn't know</title> <ref
	target="#frankjackson1986">(Jackson 1986).</ref>
	The argument furthered by the two is usually referred to as
	<hi rend="italic">the knowledge argument</hi>
	<ref target="#ianravenscroft2005">(Ravenscroft 2005: 171).</ref>
	Formalising <ref
	target="#frankjackson1986">Jackson (1986: 291)</ref> a bit further, the argument could look roughly as follows:</p>

	<list xml:id="jacksonsargument"  type="syllogism">
	  <item xml:id="label_a">
	    <label>(A)</label>
	    <p>Physicalism is the idea that the world is not only
	    largely physical but <hi rend="bold">completely</hi>
	    physical.  On this point <ref
	    target="#frankjackson1986">Jackson (1986: 291, see his footnote 1)</ref> argues
	    that if physicalism is true,
	    and if you know everything expressible in a physical language,
	    then you know <hi rend="bold">absolutely</hi> everything.</p>
	  </item>
	  <item xml:id="label_b">
	    <label>(B)</label>
	    <p>Suppose that our world <formula notation="eqn" rend="inline">W</formula> is <hi rend="bold">not completely</hi> physical.
	    Then there is a possible world <formula notation="eqn" rend="inline">W prime</formula> which is.</p>
	  </item>
	  <item xml:id="label_c">
	    <label>(C)</label>
	    <p>Since the world <formula notation="eqn" rend="inline">W prime</formula> is completely physical,
	    the difference between that world and our world <formula notation="eqn" rend="inline">W</formula>  must be facts that cannot be expressed in a physical language <ref target="#frankjackson1986">(Jackson 1986: 291).</ref></p>
	  </item>
	</list>

	<p rend='noindentfirst'>Now, please recall
	that what <ref target="#jjcsmart1959">Smart (op cit.)</ref>
	regarded as <ref target="#unbelievable_according_to_smart">unbelievable
	were sensations</ref> and that those are what <ref
	target="#thomasnagel1974">Nagel (op cit.)</ref> regarded as
	essential (for understanding bats: echolocation).
	Jackson's and Nagel's works provoked a response by <ref
	target="#derkpereboom1994">Pereboom (1994).</ref>
	Here I study the papers papers by Jackson and Pereboom.
	I first present Jackson's view and then I turn to Pereboom and compare the two.
	Finally I add my own conclusions and make a
	brief comparison with <ref
	target="#ianravenscroft2005">Ravenscroft (2005: 172)</ref></p>

	<head>What Mary Didn't Know</head>

	<p rend='noindentfirst'>Mary's black-and-white room is a
	thought experiment proposed by Jackson.  He has discussed it
	in a number of essays.  I will concentrate on <ref
	target="#frankjackson1986">Jackson (1986),</ref> even though
	it is not his first treatment of the problem.
	His brief note was written as a reply to <ref
	target="#paulchurchland1985">Churchland (1985),</ref> who in his
	turn had attacked those earlier papers.
	I will not further discuss Churchland.</p>

	<p>Mary is an extremely gifted neuroscientist.
	Since birth she has been confined to a room furnished completely in black-and-white.
	She has spent her whole life there, studying
	physiology, cognition, physics, colour, optics etc, using
	black-and-white books, journals and TV set.  If physicalism is
	true she knows absolutely everything there is to know that can
	be formulated in a physical language.  Which is everything,
	simpliciter.  If there is more to know, then physicalism is
	false.
	Or so claims <ref target="#frankjackson1986">Jackson (1986).</ref></p>

	<p>Eventually she is released from her confinement,
	and the questions are:
	What did she learn when she met the real world?
	In particular, what did she say when she first saw a ripe red tomato?</p>

	<p>Following <ref target="#frankjackson1986">Jackson
	(1986),</ref> this how Mary's black-and-white room narrative
	can be boiled down to an argument:</p>

	<list xml:id="jacksonformalizingmary"  type="syllogism">

	    <label>(1)</label>
	    <p>From <ref target="#label_a">(A) above:</ref>

	    release) knows everything physical there is to know about
	    other people.</quote> <ref target="#frankjackson1986">(Jackson

	  </item>
	  <item xml:id="label_2">

	    them on her release).</quote> <ref target="#frankjackson1986">(Jackson
	    1986: 293).</ref></p>
	  </item>

	  </item>
	</list>
	
	<p>So what did Mary learn? <ref
	target="#frankjackson1986">Jackson (1986: 293)</ref> claims that she
	learned something about other people. What she <hi
	rend="italic"><quote>did not know until her release is not a
	physical fact about about their experiences. But it was a fact
	about them. That is the trouble for physicalism.</quote></hi>
	Jackson does not tell us what she said. Only what <hi rend="bold">she did not say:</hi>  <hi
	rend="italic"><quote>ho, hum</quote></hi>  <ref

      </div>

      <div xml:id="pereboom">
	<head>Pereboom's analysis</head>

	<p rend='noindentfirst'><ref
	target="#derkpereboom1994">Pereboom (1994)</ref> discusses
	both <ref target="#thomasnagel1974">Nagel's (1974)</ref> and
	<ref target="#frankjackson1986">Jackson's (1986)</ref>
	treatments of the knowledge argument (I'll concentrate on his discussion of the latter, though).
	More specifically, Pereboom (1994) starts with <ref
	target="#paulchurchland1985">Churchland (1985).</ref> <ref
	target="#derkpereboom1994">Pereboom (1994: 316)</ref> is
	convinced that his <hi
	rend='italic'><quote xml:id="thatstrategy">strategy can be enhanced to resolve the
	controversy in favor of the materialist.</quote></hi></p>

	<p>Before attacking <ref target="#frankjackson1986">Jackson's (1986)</ref> argument, he presents how Mary's Room
	could be formalised. Quoting verbatim from <ref
	target="#derkpereboom1994">Pereboom (1994: 318):</ref></p>
	<cit><quote>
	<list type="syllogism">
	  <item xml:id="pereboomsmary1">
	    <label>(i)</label>
	    <p>Mary (while in the room) knows everything physical there is to
	  know about human beings.</p></item>
	  <item xml:id="pereboomsmary2">
	    <label>(ii)</label>
	    <p>Mary (while in the room) does not know everything there is to
	    know about the nature of human sensations and their properties.</p>
	  </item>
	</list>
	<p rend='noindentfirst'>Therefore</p>
	<list type="syllogism">
	  <item xml:id="pereboomsmary3">
	    <label>(C)</label>
	    <p>There is information about human sensations that is not physical,
	  and thus human sensations are not completely physical.</p></item>
	</list>
	</quote></cit>
	<p rend='noindentfirst'>The differences between Jackson's and
	Pereboom's first premises could hardly be larger.
	Jackson is focusing on that Mary knows everything about <hi rend="bold">other human
	beings</hi> that can be formulated in
	a <hi rend="bold">physical language,</hi> see <ref target="#label_1">(1).</ref></p>
	<p>Pereboom is much more vague, see his premise <ref
	target="#pereboomsmary1">(i).</ref> For him, Mary just
	knows everything physical about  <hi rend="bold">humans in general.</hi></p>

	<p>The difference between the consequents are different as
	well. Jackson's Mary realises, upon her release, that there
	were important things she did not know about other people's
	perceptions. See <ref target="#label_3">(3).</ref>
	Pereboom's consequent <ref target="#pereboomsmary3">(C)</ref> just
	concludes that there is information about human sensations
	that are not completely physical.</p>

	<p>Clearly, Jackson's views have evolved over time. It seems
	that <ref target="#frankjackson1986">Jackson (1986),</ref>
	successfully refutes <ref
	target="#paulchurchland1985">Churchland (1985),</ref> or
	that is what he claimed. Jackson is using a new release
	of the knowledge argument.
	<ref target="#derkpereboom1994">Pereboom's (1994)</ref> objective
	was to give support to Churchland, but however I read Pereboom
	I cannot see that he succeeds. Basically, he tries to
	defeat the previous version of the knowledge argument.
	He tries to do so using minor variations of an
	argument Jackson had already refuted several years earlier.</p>

	<p><ref
	target="#derkpereboom1994">Pereboom (1994: 316)</ref> claims that  Jackson implicitly assumes <hi
	rend="italic"><quote>that if materialism is true, then
	complete physical knowledge will provide cognitive access to
	everything about a subject's mental states as they are
	apprehended in introspection</quote></hi> <ref
	target="#derkpereboom1994">(Pereboom 1994: 316).</ref>
	Pereboom (op cit.) claims it to be false.
	False of true, this argument seems irrelevant to me; when Mary is released she
	realises something about others, not about herself <ref
	target="#label_3">(3),</ref> a realisation which is impossible
	to formulate in a physical language and that does not require introspection.</p>

	<p>Another core argument is that Mary through, her complete
	knowledge of everything physical related to human beings, as
	<ref
	    target="#derkpereboom1994">Pereboom (1994: 320)</ref> puts it (cf. <ref
	    target="#pereboomsmary1">(i)</ref> above),
	would be able to gain important knowledge about others perception through inter-subjective accessibility.
	Since the Mary's room narrative is about what happens after she has left the confinement,
	I cannot see that this is relevant.</p>
	
      </div>
      
      <div xml:id="conclusions">
	<head>Conclusions</head>
	<p rend='noindentfirst'><ref target="#ianravenscroft2005">Ravenscroft (2005: 172)</ref>
	reached a similar conclusion.
	He points out that Jackson's (op cit.) describes Mary's lack of knowledge as a lack of understanding of what others knew about the visual cues of ripe red tomatoes.
	Jackson evaded the objections to his argument.
	He evaded not only <ref target="#paulchurchland1985">Churchland (1985),</ref>
	but also <ref target="#derkpereboom1994">Pereboom (1994).</ref> Basically, Pereboom  refer to Jackson (1986) but does not really respond to it. Pereboom's paper is basically about earlier versions of the knowledge argument.</p>

	<p><ref target="#jjcsmart1963">Smart (1963: 651)</ref> wrote
	that he does <hi rend="italic"><quote>not hold materialism to
	be wedded to the billiard-ball physics of the nineteenth
	century.</quote></hi> I think that is good.  However, a few
	years earlier he wrote that <hi rend="italic"><quote>science
	is increasingly giving us a viewpoint whereby organisms are
	able to be seen as physico-chemical mechanisms</quote></hi>
	<ref target="#jjcsmart1959">(Smart 1959: 142).</ref> Depending
	on what you actually understand by physico-chemical mechanisms,
	this might be seen as an improvement from billiard-ball physics.
	From my point of view it seems only marginally so.
	He then continues: <hi rend="italic"><quote>it seems that even
	the behavior of man himself will one day be explicable in
	mechanistic terms.</quote></hi> Who, if anyone, doubts that?
	To me the question is not whether behaviours should be
	described mechanistically.  The question is what mechanisms
	should be used when doing so.  <ref
	target="#reductionism">Brigandt &amp; Love (2023)</ref>
	mention that in late 20th and early 21st century
	philosophy of biology, one important problem has been if <hi
	rend="italic"><quote>classical genetics can be reduced to
	molecular genetics.</quote></hi>
	Now we have billiard balls,
	physico-chemical mechanisms and molecular genetics.
	Three data points:
	With some inductive expansion we can conclude that we are on the right track.
	If the trend continues we might be relieved from seeing attempts to explain the theory of natural selection using quantum gravity.</p>

	<p><ref target="#reductionism">Brigandt &amp; Love
	(2023)</ref> also provide nice explanations of some of the
	theories of theory reduction, and from my point view they (and
	references in their article) save philosophy. A theory
	reduction occurs when we have two theories <formula
	rend="inline" notation="eqn">T sub A</formula> and <formula
	notation="eqn" rend="inline">T sub B .</formula> The theory
	<formula rend="inline" notation="eqn">T sub A</formula> is
	said said to reduce theory <formula notation="eqn"
	rend="inline">T sub B </formula> if the former entails the
	latter. This implies that the reducing theory should be capable of
	explaining the problems addressed in the reduced theory.</p>

	<p>Think of physics as  <formula
	rend="inline" notation="eqn">T sub A</formula> and what is in Mary's head when she holds a ripe tomato in her hand as theory <formula
	rend="inline" notation="eqn">T sub B .</formula> She understands that all other people have eaten this wonderful fruit each early summer, while she ate black hamburgers with white bread and black-and-white ketchup.</p>
