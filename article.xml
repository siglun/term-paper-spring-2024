	<head>Introduction</head>

	<p rend='noindentfirst'>Biology is, writes <ref

	rend='italic'><quote xml:id="unbelievable_according_to_smart">to physics as radio-engineering is to
	electromagnetism) except the occurrence of sensations seems to
	me to be frankly unbelievable.</quote></hi> The effect such a
	statement have on biologists and biologically inclined philosophers could be easily foreseen.
	I think it is safe to assume that Smart was wilfully provocative.
	<ref target="#jjcsmart1959">Smart's (op cit.)</ref> and others' works led to
	a <hi rend='italic'><quote>wave of reductionist euphoria</quote></hi>
	or that is how <ref target="#thomasnagel1974">Nagel (1974: 435)</ref>
	puts it in his seminal paper <title>What is it like to be a bat</title>.
	Nagel discusses at length that chiropterology (the scientific study of bats) has to study
	<hi rend="italic">how it is like</hi>
	how to see the world using echolocation.</p>

	<p>Nagel was later joined by Jackson who wrote a series of papers,
	including <title>What Mary Didn't know</title> <ref
	target="#frankjackson1986">(Jackson 1986).</ref>
	The argument furthered by the two is usually referred to as
	<hi rend="italic">the knowledge argument</hi>
	<ref target="#ianravenscroft2005">Ravenscroft (2005: 171).</ref>
	Formalizing <ref
	target="#frankjackson1986">Jackson (1986: 291)</ref> a bit further, the argument could look roughly as follows:</p>

	<list xml:id="jacksonsargument"  type="syllogism">
	  <item xml:id="label_a">
	    <label>(A)</label>
	    <p>Physicalism is the idea that the world is not only
	    largely physical but <hi rend="bold">completely</hi>
	    physical.  On this point <ref
	    target="#frankjackson1986">Jackson (1986: 291, see his footnote 1)</ref> argues
	    that if physicalism is true,
	    and if you know everything expressible in a physical language,
	    then you know <hi rend="bold">absolutely</hi> everything.</p>
	  </item>
	  <item xml:id="label_b">
	    <label>(B)</label>
	    <p>Suppose that our world <hi rend="italic">W</hi> is <hi rend="bold">not completely</hi> physical.
	    Then there is a possible world <hi rend="italic">W'</hi> which is.</p>
	  </item>
	  <item xml:id="label_c">
	    <label>(C)</label>
	    <p>Since the world <hi rend="italic">W'</hi> is completely physical,
	    the difference between that world and our <hi
	    rend="italic">W</hi> must be facts that cannot be
	    expressed in a physical language <ref target="#frankjackson1986">(Jackson 1986: 291).</ref></p>
	  </item>
	</list>

	<p rend='noindentfirst'>Now, please recall
	that what <ref target="#jjcsmart1959">Smart (op cit.)</ref>
	regarded as <ref target="#unbelievable_according_to_smart">unbelievable
	were sensations</ref> and that what <ref
	target="#thomasnagel1974">Nagel (op cit.)</ref> regarded as
	essential was just sensations (and for understanding bats:
	echolocation).
	Jackson's and Nagel's works provoked a response by <ref
	target="#derkpereboom1994">Pereboom (1994).</ref>
	Here I study the papers papers by Jackson and Pereboom. I first
	present Jackson's view and then I turn to Pereboom and compare
	it with Jackson's. Finally I add my own conclusions and make a
	brief comparison with <ref
	target="#ianravenscroft2005">Ravenscroft (2005: 172)</ref></p>

	<head>What Mary Didn't Know</head>

	<p rend='noindentfirst'>Mary's black-and-white room is a
	thought experiment proposed by Jackson.  He has discussed it
	in a number of essays.  I will concentrate on <ref
	target="#frankjackson1986">Jackson (1986),</ref> even though
	it is not his first treatment of the problem.  This brief note
	was written as a reply to <ref
	target="#paulchurchland1985">Churchland (1985),</ref> who in
	turned had attacked those earlier papers. I will not here
	further discuss Churchland.</p>

	<p>Mary is an extremely gifted neuroscientist.  Since birth
	she has been confined to a room furnished completely in
	black-and-white.  She has spent her whole life there, studying
	physiology, cognition, physics, colour, optics etc, using
	black-and-white books, journals and TV set.  If physicalism is
	true she knows absolutely everything there is to know that can
	be formulated in a physical language.  Which is everything,
	simpliciter.  If there is more to know, then physicalism is
	false.
	Or so claims <ref target="#frankjackson1986">Jackson (1986).</ref></p>

	<p>Eventually she is released from her confinement,
	and the questions are:
	What did she learn when she meets the real world?
	In particular, what did she say when she first saw a ripe red tomato?</p>

	<p>Following <ref target="#frankjackson1986">Jackson
	(1986),</ref> this how Mary's black-and-white room narrative
	can be boiled down to an argument:</p>

	    <p>From <ref target="#label_a">(A):</ref>

	    release) knows everything physical there is to know about

      <div xml:id="pereboom">
	<head>Pereboom's analysis</head>

	<p rend='noindentfirst'><ref
	target="#derkpereboom1994">Pereboom (1994)</ref> discusses
	both <ref target="#thomasnagel1974">Nagel (1974)</ref> and
	<ref target="#frankjackson1986">Jackson (1986)</ref>
	treatments of the knowledge argument. More specifically,
	Pereboom (op cit.) starts with <ref
	target="#paulchurchland1985">Churchland (1985)</ref>. <ref
	target="#derkpereboom1994">Pereboom (1986: 316)</ref> is
	convinced that this <hi
	rend='italic'><quote xml:id="thatstrategy">strategy can be enhanced to resolve the
	controversy in favor of the materialist.</quote></hi></p>

	<p>Before attacking the argument, he presents how Mary's Room
	could be formalized. Quoting verbatim from <ref
	target="#derkpereboom1994">Pereboom (1994: 318):</ref></p>

	<list type="syllogism">
	  <item xml:id="pereboomsmary1">
	    <label>(i)</label>
	    <p>Mary (while in the room) knows everything physical there is to
	  know about human beings.</p></item>
	  <item xml:id="pereboomsmary2">
	    <label>(ii)</label>
	    <p>Mary (while in the room) does not know everything there is to
know about the nature of human sensations and their properties.</p>
	  </item>
	</list>
	<p rend='noindentfirst'>Therefore</p>
	<list type="syllogism">
	  <item xml:id="pereboomsmary3">
	    <label>(C)</label>
	    <p>There is information about human sensations that is not physical,
	  and thus human sensations are not completely physical.</p></item>
	</list>

	<p rend='noindentfirst'>The differences between Jackson's and
	Pereboom's first premises could hardly be larger.
	Jackson is focussing on that Mary knows everything that can be formulated in
	a <hi rend="bold">physical language</hi> about <hi rend="bold">other human
	beings,</hi> see <ref target="#label_1">(1).</ref>
	Pereboom is much more vague, see his premise <ref
	target="#pereboomsmary1">(i).</ref> For him, Mary just
	knows everything physical about humans in general.</p>

	<p>The difference between the consequents are different as
	well. Jackson's Mary realizes, upon her release, that there
	were important things she did not know about other people's
	perceptions. See <ref target="#label_3">(3).</ref> Pereboom's
	consequent <ref target="#pereboomsmary3">(C)</ref> just
	concludes that there is information about human sensations
	that are not completely physical.</p>

	<p>Clearly, Jackson's views have evolved over time </p>

	<head>Conclusions</head>
	<p rend='noindentfirst'><ref target="#ianravenscroft2005">Ravenscroft (2005:
	172)</ref> reached a similar conclusion; by describing Mary's
	lack of knowledge as that she did not understand what other
	knew about red tomatoes, Ravenscroft evaded the objection to
	his argument described above.</p>
